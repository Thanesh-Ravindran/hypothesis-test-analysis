    "An A/B Test is a randomized experiment in which a two or more variants a variable are deployed to different segments of customers to determine which of the variant is most effective in boosting KPIs. Here are some scenarios where AB testing is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Streaming services: Determining whether changing the movie recommendation algorithm increases user engagement\n",
    "- E-commerce: Determining which product page layout results in the highest proportion of checkouts\n",
    "Product & Service Advertising: Determining if the usage of emojis in Advertisment headlines result in higher click rates\n",
    "\n",
    "For this case, we will be analysing the A/B test results data of an online learning platform. The platform operates on a freemium model, some of its courses are free, but the advanced courses are locked behind a paywall. The platform provides a 2 week trial for its advanced courses. At the end of the trial period, users are directed to a paywall. Two paywall variants with differing headlines were compared in this A/B test. \n",
